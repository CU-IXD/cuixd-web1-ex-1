Apply what you've learned in this module by creating your first set of basic website files.

1. Use the Codio system to create the files and folders that make up a standard site structure based on what you learned in Lesson 1. 
    1. Refer to the content for a specific set of 2 common files and 2 common folders. 
    2. When you create files and Codio asks what File type and Template to use be sure to choose "None".
2. Place the required minimum HTML document structure in the site's home page. No further content is needed but feel free to experiment with some HTML if you like.

After completing these steps you're finished with the exercise. You *DO NOT* need to submit this exercise or mark it as complete. Your professor will grade based on what they find here after the deadline has passed. 

Note: The `comments.md` file is here for you and your professor to enter any comments or questions.
